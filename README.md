**Location Wise Product**

- Kolkata

Skincare products have the highest sales volume, indicating a strong demand for skincare in this region.
Cosmetics and haircare products also have significant sales but are slightly lower compared to skincare.

- Solution:

Capitalize on the high demand for skincare products by expanding the range of skincare offerings and promoting them through targeted marketing campaigns.

**Product Availability**

The consistent availability of skincare products across all locations highlights the widespread popularity and demand for skincare in the market.

 Recommendations:

- Product Expansion: Given the high demand for skincare products, retailers and brands should consider expanding their skincare product offerings to cater to different skin types, concerns, and preferences.

- Marketing Emphasis: Allocate marketing resources to highlight skincare products, emphasizing their benefits, ingredients, and effectiveness to attract and retain customers.

- Strategic Partnerships: Collaborate with skincare experts, dermatologists, and influencers to endorse skincare products and build credibility and trust among consumers.

- Distribution Channels: Ensure skincare products are readily available across various distribution channels, including online platforms, retail stores, and specialty outlets, to reach a wider audience and maximize sales potential.


**Defect Rates Analysis**

- Road transportation has the highest defect rate compared to other modes.


- Skincare products may be particularly susceptible to defects during road transportation due to their fragile nature and sensitivity to temperature and environmental conditions.

- Common defects associated with road transportation of skincare products may include product breakage, leakage, contamination, and degradation of quality.

- Temperature fluctuations during transit, rough handling, and prolonged delivery times on the road can exacerbate these defects.
